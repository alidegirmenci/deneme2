===================================
Once there was a kind man. He had a *very loving wife.*
He had a young daughter who was **also just like her mother. 
One day the man's wife died**, and he was very sad.

The man wanted a new wife. ``He found one, but`` she was not 
kind at all. She was very cruel. She had two ugly daughters 
who were also very mean.
